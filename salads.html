A perfect creamy, nutritious and crunchy salad, makes it more colourful with addition of coloured radishes available from your local market; try and acquire organic radishes .

            <p class="dish-discription">If you thought salads are boring, I agree with you. And if you thought a best was to eat a salad if at all you have to eat it should be with a delicious dressing, I’m with you on that as well.

                Salads remind me of summer. It’s light on your tummy, but very satisfying too. And when you make a salad that screams fresh, light and summery, you will probably think of a dressing that is also fresh and turns the salad into one delicious super food</p>
