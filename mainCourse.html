            <h2 class="dish-name">Chicken dum biryani</h2>
            <p class="dish-discription">Dum means to simmer. To cook on very low flame, mostly in sealed containers, allowing the meat to cook, as much as possible, in their own juices and bone-marrow. Usually, a covered pot is sealed to create pressure to ensure cooking is low and slow.

                The discovery of this cooking method is quite fascinating. During a famine, enormous containers were filled with rice, vegetables, meat and spices and sealed. Hot charcoal was placed on top and fires lit beneath to keep the food warm. However, the method employed allowed the ingredients to wallow in their own aroma or juices and the trapped steam cooked the ingredients to perfection. When the containers were unsealed, the aroma and the splendid flavours of the food had people spellbound. Thus, the art of dum cooking was born.

            <h2 class="dish-name">Matar Paneer</h2>
            <p class="dish-discription">Matar Paneer is a popular Indian curry made with paneer which is Indian cottage cheese and green peas. It can be made in various ways and usually enjoyed with rotis, paratha and rice. The paneer and peas are cooked with aromatic spices and the curry usually has a base of onions and tomatoes.

                In India, my mom would often make matar paneer during winters when fresh peas were in season. The fresh peas added to the freshness of the dish. However, these days people make it all the time using frozen peas. Here in the United States, I donâ€™t see fresh peas very often so I almost always make my matar paneer using frozen peas. This recipe uses frozen peas too.</p>
